# Graph Neural Network RoadMap 
In this repo I will give a roadmap about how to learn GNN, according to my experience. 

It will be a effective way to learn GNN.

## Pytorch geometric
It is a powerful libary for GNN(like pytorch for deep learning). So it's neccessary for you to pick up it

It may be confused if you don't have experience about signal and system, Don't worry, following videoes will help you!

Part 2 will explain Fourier and Laplacian in graph convolution.
### Code

I will explain this code step by step in another repo.
