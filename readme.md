# Graph Neural Network RoadMap 
In this repo I will give a roadmap about how to learn GNN, according to my experience. 

It will be a effective way to learn GNN.

## Pytorch geometric
It is a powerful libary for GNN(like pytorch for deep learning). So it's neccessary for you to pick up it

## GCN

It may be confused if you don't have experience in signal and system. Don't worry, following videoes will guide you!

Part 2 explain Fourier and Laplacian in graph convolution.

### source code 
I will explain GCN and Chebconv [code](./GNN_source_code/) based on pyg step by step.
